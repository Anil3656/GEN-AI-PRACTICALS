No.\\n\\nThere is no function overloading in Python\\n\\nUnlike C++, a Python function is specified by its name alone The number, order, names, or types of arguments cannot be used to distinguish between two functions with the same name\\n\\nTwo different functions can’t have the same name, even if they have different arguments\\n\\nBut: see operator overloading in later slides (Note: van Rossum playing with function overloading for the future)\\n\\nDefault Values for Arguments\\n\\nYou can provide default values for a function’s arguments\\n\\nThese arguments are optional when the function is called\\n\\n>>> def myfun(b, c=3, d=“hello”):\\n\\nreturn b + c >>> myfun(5,3,”hello”) >>> myfun(5,3) >>> myfun(5)\\n\\nAll of the above function calls return 8\\n\\nKeyword Arguments\\n\\nCan call a function with some/all of its arguments out of order as long as you specify their names >>> def foo(x,y,z): return(2*x,4*y,8*z) >>> foo(2,3,4) (4, 12, 32) >>> foo(z=4, y=2, x=3) (6, 8, 32) >>> foo(-2, z=-4, y=-3) (-4, -12, -32)\\n\\nCan be combined with defaults, too\\n\\n>>> def foo(x=1,y=2,z=3): return(2*x,4*y,8*z) >>> foo() (2, 8, 24) >>> foo(z=100) (2, 8, 800)\\n\\nFunctions are first-class objects\\n\\nFunctions can be used as any other\\n\\ndatatype, eg: •\\u202fArguments to function •\\u202fReturn values of functions •\\u202fAssigned to variables •\\u202fParts of tuples, lists, etc\\n\\n>>> def square(x): return x*x\\n\\n>>> def applier(q, x): return q(x)\\n\\n>>> applier(square, 7) 49\\n\\nLambda Notation\\n\\nPython’s lambda creates anonymous functions >>> applier(lambda z: z * 42, 7) 14 •\\u202fNote: only one expression in the lambda\\n\\nbody; its value is always returned\\n\\nPython supports functional programming idioms: map, filter, closures, continuations, etc.\\n\\nLambda Notation\\n\\nBe careful with the syntax >>> f = lambda x,y : 2 * x + y >>> f <function <lambda> at 0x87d30> >>> f(3, 4) 10 >>> v = lambda x: x*x(100) >>> v <function <lambda> at 0x87df0> >>> v = (lambda x: x*x)(100) >>> v 10000\\n\\nExample: composition\\n\\n>>> def square(x): return x*x >>> def twice(f): return lambda x: f(f(x)) >>> twice <function twice at 0x87db0> >>> quad = twice(square) >>> quad <function <lambda> at 0x87d30> >>> quad(5) 625\\n\\nExample: closure\\n\\n>>> def counter(start=0, step=1): x = [start] def _inc(): x[0] += step return x[0] return _inc >>> c1 = counter() >>> c2 = counter(100, -10) >>> c1() 1 >>> c2() 90\\n\\nmap, filter, reduce\\n\\n>>> def add1(x): return x+1 >>> def odd(x): return x%2 == 1 >>> def add(x,y): return x + y >>> map(add1, [1,2,3,4]) [2, 3, 4, 5] >>> map(+,[1,2,3,4],[100,200,300,400]) map(+,[1,2,3,4],[100,200,300,400]) ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax >>> map(add,[1,2,3,4],[100,200,300,400]) [101, 202, 303, 404] >>> reduce(add, [1,2,3,4]) 10 >>> filter(odd, [1,2,3,4]) [1, 3]\\n\\nPython\\n\\nfunctional programming\\n\\nFunctions are first-class objects\\n\\nFunctions can be used as any other\\n\\ndatatype, eg: •\\u202fArguments to function •\\u202fReturn values of functions •\\u202fAssigned to variables •\\u202fParts of tuples, lists, etc\\n\\n>>> def square(x): return x*x\\n\\n>>> def applier(q, x): return q(x)\\n\\n>>> applier(square, 7) 49\\n\\nLambda Notation\\n\\nPython’s lambda creates anonymous functions >>> lambda x: x + 1 <function <lambda> at 0x1004e6ed8> >>> f = lambda x: x + 1 >>> f <function <lambda> at 0x1004e6f50> >>> f(100) 101\\n\\nLambda Notation\\n\\nBe careful with the syntax >>> f = lambda x,y: 2 * x + y >>> f <function <lambda> at 0x87d30> >>> f(3, 4) 10 >>> v = lambda x: x*x(100) >>> v <function <lambda> at 0x87df0> >>> v = (lambda x: x*x)(100) >>> v 10000\\n\\nLambda Notation Limitations\\n\\nNote: only one expression in the lambda body;

Applies the function to each element in the iterable and returns a new iterable containing only the elements for which the function returns `True`.\\n\\t* Example: `filter(odd, [1, 2, 3, 4])` would return `[1, 3]` if `odd` is a function that checks if a number is odd.\\n2. **Map**:\\n\\t* Purpose: To apply a transformation to each element in a collection.\\n\\t* Syntax: `map(function, iterable)`\\n\\t* Function: Takes a function and an iterable as input. Applies the function to each element in the iterable and returns a new iterable containing the transformed elements.\\n\\t* Example: `map(square, [1, 2, 3, 4])` would return `[1, 4, 9, 16]` if `square` is a function that squares a number.\\n3. **Reduce**:\\n\\t* Purpose: To combine all elements in a collection into a single output value.\\n\\t* Syntax: `reduce(function, iterable)`\\n\\t* Function: Takes a function and an iterable as input.
